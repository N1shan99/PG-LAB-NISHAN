print("IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It’s a coding tool which allows 
you to write, test, and debug your code in an easier way, as they typically offer code 
completion or code insight by highlighting, resource management, debugging 
tools,… And even though the IDE is a strictly defined concept, it’s starting to be
 redefined as other tools such as notebooks start gaining more and more features 
that traditionally belong to IDEs.

Comparison between IDLE and Thonny

  Thonny is built for education and you can download the latest version from the
 Thonny website. The download options are at the top right. Thonny looks quite
 different to IDLE - it has different panels for the editor, the shell and the variables
 watcher plus (show view) lots of other options as well. It has a powerful debugger
 built in and other tools which let you manage packages and plugins.
  The IDLE editor comes built-in with Python and is the one that many tutorials use 
by default. It's a fine, basic, editor that also has a Python shell built in for interactive
 programming.When you start Idle up, you get the shell window. This allows you to 
execute python commands and see the results immediately without having to create 
a program. This can be useful for trying things out.")
